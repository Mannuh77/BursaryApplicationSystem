**Kibwezi West Constituency Bursary Application System**

Welcome to the Kibwezi West Constituency Bursary Application System—a fully-featured web application designed to streamline and digitize the bursary application process, benefiting residents and administrators alike.

**Project Overview:**

This system enables eligible residents to easily register, apply for bursaries, and track the progress of their applications online. Built with a powerful combination of front-end and back-end technologies, this platform brings transparency and efficiency to the bursary distribution process.

**Technologies Used:**

Front-End: Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a smooth and user-friendly interface. The front-end design is responsive and intuitive, allowing users to navigate the application seamlessly across devices.

Back-End: Powered by PHP, the server-side logic processes data securely, handles form submissions, and interacts with the database to provide a dynamic experience.

REST APIs: RESTful APIs connect the front-end with the back-end, allowing real-time data handling. These APIs are designed to support actions like user registration, application submission, status retrieval, and more, ensuring smooth and efficient communication.

Database: The database is managed using SQL, storing and organizing all user information, application data, and admin activities. This enables secure, reliable data retrieval and management for both users and administrators.

Key Features:
For Users:
User Registration and Login: Residents can create personal accounts with secure authentication, ensuring their data is kept private and accessible only to them.
Biodata Management: Users can easily input and update personal and educational details required for application consideration.
Bursary Application Submission: Applicants can complete and submit bursary applications with a few clicks, making the process accessible and convenient.
Application Status Tracking: Users can monitor their application status and receive updates directly on their dashboard.
For Administrators:
Admin Dashboard: Provides a centralized dashboard for administrators to manage user data, view and process applications, and update statuses.
Application Review: Administrators can review and validate user-submitted applications with efficiency and accuracy.
Data Management and Reporting: Enables administrators to generate reports and manage data systematically, ensuring a transparent bursary distribution process.
Why This System Matters:
This platform brings structure and accessibility to the bursary application process, enabling equitable support distribution. By centralizing the application, tracking, and management features, both residents and administrators benefit from a more transparent and efficient system.
